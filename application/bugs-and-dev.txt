Requested Features

- ability to export an excel file and then reimport it.
    - How to deal with updated data though? Only want to import that which has changed.

- Searching on the site works when you click directly on a filter, and also when you unclick a filter. However if you end up in a dictionary that does not have a result, then even if you unclick it, you do not get the previous fields back.
- Clicking on a filter dictionary before entering a search term should result in the whole dictionary being returned, and when you unclick it, should return the homepage or some other placeholder, not just nothing.

- Once you search, clicking on an individual term produces no output.
- Click backwards in the browser results in loss of formatting, must be a problem with single page saving
- when a search is ongoing, I need a process indicator to show that the process has not hanged
