# OLLI Begreppstjanst

This is a terminology service developed at the Västra Götalands Region department of Informatics and Standardisation. The point of the service is to serve terms and concepts to consumers within the organisation in a clean interface. Users can search for terms, request definitions of terms and query existing definitions. 

The content and variable names are currently an unfortunate mix of Swedish and English, though there is planning to move any ambiguity out of the application to make it more adaptable.
